## Development

This project is created using the tool [Saloon](https://docs.saloon.dev/). 
A PHP package that helps you write beautiful API integrations. It introduces a standardised, fluent syntax to communicate with third party services.

It's possible to just extend the MiddlewareConnector and apply your own custom logic, and follow their documentation.
